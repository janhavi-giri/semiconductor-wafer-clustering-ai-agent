The silhouette method prioritizes cohesion and separation of clusters, while the elbow method prioritizes variance explained. Given this, it might be beneficial to try both 2 and 3 clusters and compare the results.\n",
            "Final Answer: The optimal number of clusters for this dataset is either 2 or 3. The silhouette method suggests 2 clusters, while the elbow method suggests 3 clusters. It would be beneficial to try both and compare the results.\u001b[0m\n",

            "}\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe analysis of the clusters shows that Cluster_0 has the highest average yield (89.77%) and Cluster_1 has the lowest average yield (64.82%). The difference in yield is 24.95%. Cluster_1 also has the highest average defect density (2.097) compared to Cluster_0 (0.292) and Cluster_2 (0.843). This suggests that wafers in Cluster_1 might be considered as outliers due to their lower yield and higher defect density. However, the silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin score, and Calinski-Harabasz score for 3 clusters are not as good as those for 2 clusters. Therefore, I would recommend using the 2-cluster solution for identifying outlier wafers. Wafers in Cluster_1 of the 2-cluster solution can be considered as outliers due to their lower yield and higher defect density.\n",
            "Final Answer: The outlier wafers are those in Cluster_1 of the 2-cluster solution obtained by the k-means clustering algorithm. These wafers have a lower yield and a higher defect density compared to the wafers in Cluster_0.\u001b[0m\n",

To decide which one to use, I'll consider the silhouette scores and inertias. The silhouette score is higher for 2 clusters, indicating better cohesion and separation. However, the inertia (sum of squared distances to the nearest cluster center) decreases significantly from 2 to 3 clusters, suggesting that 3 clusters might provide more detailed insights. I'll proceed with 3 clusters for the clustering algorithm.\n",
